Make your website faster by reducing the weight of images. Our Wordpress image optimizer plugin can cease image weights on 80% without any loss of quality.

Robin image optimizer is a smart and advanced image optimizer that really stands out among other Wordpress plugins. Robin image optimizer is a Wordpress free image optimizer plugin with zero limitations in terms of number of images and optimization quality. The only thing that you may stumble across is the image weight, which shouldn’t exceed 5 MB.

### What’s the purpose of image optimization? ###

The lighter the weight of the image – the faster your page loads. With the constant growth of mobile users, increases the necessity in mobile websites optimization. If you don’t want to get many rejections and lose money due to the poor ad performances, we’d recommend you to start with image optimization.

###  Why should we use Robin image optimizer for image optimization? ###

*  The first and the most significant difference from the counterparts: our plugin is absolutely free and has the same features as paid products.
*  This Wordpress image optimizer doesn't have any limits or restrictions in image optimization.
*  Automatic optimization using Cron. You don't need to wait til optimization is completed; the plugin will be optimizing couple of images every several minutes in the background.
*  Manual mass-optimization. Press the button and wait til your images are optimized
*  Image backup. Before optimization starts, all images are being stored in original quality. Then, when optimization is over, you can restore lost images or re-optimize them in another quality.
*  You can choose compression mode (normal, regular, high). Compression mode influences image weight and quality. The higher the compression, the worse is the quality and the smaller is the weight.
*  Image optimization on boot.
*  Reducing pre-optimization image weight by changing image size.
*  Detailed statistics on optimized images

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Why is this plugin free and how long it will be this way? =

Our Wordpress plugin to optimize images uses API of this free service: https://resmush.it, So as long as these guys allow free image optimization, our plugin will remain free. Still, we have several ideas of how to make optimization free and planning to implement them in our plugin.

= Are there any limits for image optimization? =
There are no limits for image optimization in our plugin. The only thing we have is a kind of a restriction of image weight – it should be greater than 5 MB. But our plugin can reduce pre-optimization image weight, so you’ll be able to optimize almost all images you have.

= What image formats do you support? =
Robin image optimizer can optimize jpg, png and gif (both animated or not).

= Do you remove EXIF images data? =
EXIF-data is removed by default. However, you can keep it by disabling the feature.

= Do you remove source images? =
No. Robin image optimizer replaces images with their optimized analogues. The backup option stores source images and allows restoring them in one click.

= Can I re-optimize images in another mode? =
Yes. By enabling the backup feature in the plugin, you can re-optimize any image using another compression mode.

= Does plugin support WebP format? =
Yes, use modern image formats, such as WebP. Robin image optimizer PRO automatically creates WebP copies of your original images.

Browsers with the WebP format support will display WebP images. Other browsers will replace such images with JPG, PNP, GIF, BMP, etc.
