Generate and print PDF invoices, packing lists/packing slips, delivery notes and shipping labels for your WooCommerce orders.

== Description ==

= Introduction =

WooCommerce Print Invoice, Packing Slip, Delivery Note and Shipping Label plugin helps you generate PDF invoices, packing lists / packing slips, delivery notes, dispatch labels and shipping labels from the WooCommerce orders page. WooCommerce, by default, doesn't allow you to print any of these documents from your orders page. Using this extension, you can very well streamline your online store's shipping and order processes.

= Why do you need invoices, packing lists, etc.? =

It is a good practice to include an invoice and a packing list when you are shipping a package. It serves as a confirmation of what the package contains along with your contact information and the details of the purchase. 

When you sell internationally, it is a standard requirement in many countries to include an invoice. The invoice should contain all the required order details such as the name and address of your company, the billing address of your customer, and a list of all order items including taxes and totals.

Furthermore, it establishes an extra line of communication between you and the customer and adds a human touch.

&#9989; Tested OK with WooCommerce 7.7
&#9989; Tested OK up to PHP 8.0
